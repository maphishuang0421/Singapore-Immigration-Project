  title: Feeding Pigeons (2005)
  info: Bans feeding pigeons in public areas to control their population and reduce
    health risks. The law was introduced after concerns about the growing number
    of pigeons. Feeding them can lead to overpopulation and unsanitary conditions.
    Violators face fines to discourage the practice.
