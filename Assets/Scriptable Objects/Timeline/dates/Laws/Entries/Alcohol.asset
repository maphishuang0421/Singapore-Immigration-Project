  title: Alcohol Consumption Law (2015)
  info: "The Liquor Control Act regulates the consumption of alcohol in public places
    in Singapore. Under this law, drinking alcohol in public is prohibited between
    10:30 PM and 7:00 AM, with stricter regulations in designated Liquor Control
    Zones like Geylang and Little India. The law was introduced to reduce public
    disturbances and maintain order, especially during late-night hours. Violators
    can face fines or even imprisonment, so tourists should be mindful of this regulation
    when enjoying Singapore\u2019s nightlife."
