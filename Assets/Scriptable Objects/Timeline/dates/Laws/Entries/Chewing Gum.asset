  title: Chewing Gum Ban (1992)
  info: "Bans the import, sale, and distribution of chewing gum to maintain public
    cleanliness and prevent gum littering. The ban was introduced after issues with
    gum being stuck on public property. It was partially relaxed in 2004, allowing
    therapeutic gum for dental purposes. The law remains one of Singapore\u2019s
    most famous regulations."
