  nameAndDate: Alcohol consumption law (2015)
  dateInfo: "The Liquor Control Act regulates the consumption of alcohol in public
    places in Singapore. Under this law, drinking alcohol in public is prohibited
    between 10:30 PM and 7:00 AM, with stricter regulations in designated Liquor
    Control Zones like Geylang and Little India. The law was introduced to reduce
    public disturbances and maintain order, especially during late-night hours. Violators
    can face fines or even imprisonment, so tourists should be mindful of this regulation
    when enjoying Singapore\u2019s nightlife."
